Return statement:
    - They python return statement is the key component of functions and methods.
    - You can use the return statement to make your functions send python object
      back to the caller code.
    - These objects are known as functions return value.
    - You can use them to perform further computation in your program
    - Using return statement effectively is a core skill if you want to 
      code custom functions that are pythonic and robust
    - You can return single as well as multiple values with the return statement

Pre-requisite to understand return statement
    Functions, often called as : 
        Subroutines
        Methods
        Subprograms
        Procedures (don't return a value)
        Functions (do return a value)

    In Python, a function is a self-contained block of code that encapsulates a specific 
    task or related group of tasks.
        All Python functions return a value, wether you indicate so or not
